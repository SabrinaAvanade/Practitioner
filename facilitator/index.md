# DevOps Practitioners Facilitator Guide

This guide provides facilitators a high-level framework to understand how the DevOps Practitioners series can be conducted. The series is intended for all talent communities and provides attendees with the knowledge of how we at Avanade leverage DevOps to deliver value as a team for our clients. 

This series is likely to stretch some attendees and have them working on activities/tasks normally outside of their roles and responsibilities, but that is by design. For other more experienced attendees, alternate exercises should be given to challenge their ability. For some attendees, we should give them responsibilities to help with facilitation activities.

There is a set of work items that get generated with this content, and a set of decks. Please review the content before the series and make any recommendations to the base materail in the following backlog.

## Class setup

Bootstrap the class project with the [DevOps Practitioners](https://messp.avanade.com/Marketplace/Assets/Devops%20Practitioner) asset in the Self-Service Marketplace.

Once the project is setup you need to update the attendees by updating the attendees.json file in the .task-gen folder.

Add the task generator pipeline into the project.

To create the needed backlog for the series you can leverage the [Task Generator pipline](../.task-gen/task-generator.yml). If you need support on running the predefined backlog message Keith Lemon (k.lemon@avanade.com) for help.

## Schedule

The series normally runs over three weeks, with two classes a week. The classes normally run for 2.5 hours and provide facilitators and attendees an opportunity to over the foundational material and do some hands work. Depending on the need of the attendees, some amount of office hours may be needed, but attendees should complete all prerequisites before the start of the series to avoid unneeded office hours.
