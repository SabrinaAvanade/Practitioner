# DevOps Practitioners Facilitator Guide

This guide provides facilitators of the DevOps Practitioners series a high-level understanding of how the course can be conducted, though changing suite your audience is expected. Please note that this series is intended for all talent communities and will provide the knowledge to attendees about how Avanade leverage DevOps to deliver value as a team for our clients. This series will stretch some attendees and have them working on activities normally considered outside of their area, but that is by plan. Experience attendees we can provide stretch goals and give them responsibilities to help facilitate some of the supporting course activities like approving pull requests.

The course guides attendees in a manner that helps them when they run into issues.

## Schedule

The series normally run over three weeks with two classes a week. The classes normally run for 2.5 hours and provide facilitators and attendees an opportunity to over the foundational material and do some hands work. Depending on the need of the attendees, some amount of office hours may be needed, but attendees should complete all prerequisites before the start of the series to avoid unneeded office hours.
